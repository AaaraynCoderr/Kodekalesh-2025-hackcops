# **App Name**: QualityVision AI

## Core Features:

- Image Acquisition: Capture images of products moving along the assembly line using high-resolution cameras.
- Defect Detection: Employ a pre-trained or custom-trained AI model to identify defects in real-time based on the captured images.
- Real-Time Alerts: Automatically flag and alert line managers or operators when a defective product is detected. This can be a simple notification system within the app, immediately pausing the assembly line for rapid interventions and minimizing defect propagation.
- Data Logging & Reporting: Maintain a database of inspected products and detected defects to discover trends or predict future production issues, or allow prompt diagnosis of problems. 
- Dynamic Thresholding: Implement dynamic threshold adjustment as a tool for our quality check parameter based on real-time environmental data to prevent false positives and false negatives.
- Product Recognition: Employ an AI model that identifies the current product under inspection. It will notify downstream tools so they can adjust quality control processes automatically.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust, stability, and precision.
- Background color: Light Gray (#EEEEEE), nearly white, to provide a clean, neutral backdrop, aiding focus on the image data.
- Accent color: Vibrant Orange (#FF5722) to draw attention to alerts, critical data, and actionable items.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to give a modern, machined and objective feel suitable for displaying technical information.
- Use clear and representative icons to provide the user with relevant insight.
- Organize information for clear visibility. Keep data reporting visible, and alerts in close proximity to captured image, with actions clearly labelled
- Implement smooth transitions to highlight status changes and focus the operator on key metrics.
